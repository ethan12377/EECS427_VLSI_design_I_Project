PC's design explanation:

In view of the pipelined design, we add a stall input for the PC module.
If the instruction is a jump or branch, the stall signal should be asserted, so that the PC is not going to fetch the next instruction.
(The first stage of the pipeline is going to be locked at this time.)
After the decode result is obtained, PC can calculate the branch target according the control inputs, so it can fetch the right next PC.
In our design, branch target is calculated in PC.

Worst case delay: 2ns

Worst case delay path (3 paths in total):
1.
  Startpoint: PC_reg_3_0 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  Endpoint: PC_reg_10_0
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
2.
  Startpoint: PC_reg_1_0 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  Endpoint: PC_reg_10_0
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)

3.
  Startpoint: PC_reg_3_0 (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)
  Endpoint: PC_reg_11_0
            (rising edge-triggered flip-flop clocked by clk)

How to determine the timing constraint:
	Picking the arbitrary cycle time -> cut down the cycle time according to the slack of critical path
	In our case, we started from 4ns and all the way down to 1.2ns. 
	However, considering the routing complexity and area, we settled at 2ns.

Verilog Simulation pattern explanation:
0-15 ns 	reset
15-115ns	PC add 1 every cycle
115-125ns	testing branch address
125-135ns	testing jump address
135-295ns	stall & wait for scan chain result

Floorplan ratio:

1. We fixed core height at 74um, tried to decrease width gradually. The minimum width which can maintain correct layout is 52um.

2. We then fixed core width at 52um, tried to decrease height gradually. The minimum height which can maintain correct layout is 72.8um.

3. On this basis, gradually increase the width and decrease the height to minimize the area. The optimized size is 56um width and 61.2um height.

3. We tried to reduce the margin from the outside edge of the core box. The minimum distance which can maintain correct layout is 6.4um.

4. The floorplan ratio = (56+6.4+6.4) : (61.2+6.4+6.4) = 68.8:74 = 1:1.1
