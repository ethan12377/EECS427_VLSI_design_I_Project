Design description:

We build a custom SRAM supporting in-SRAM boolean operations.
The SRAM is at the same memory level as DMEM and supports 4 additional instructions.
All transistors are carefully sized for the READ/WRITE/AND/NOR SRAM operations.

===================================================================================

Max operating frequency for baseline processor: 225.7(MHz)
    Critical path of Datapath: 2.83(ns) (see CAD7 README)
    Critical path of Controller: 1.6(ns) (see CAD8 README)
    The critical path of the processor is path(Datapath) + path(Controller)
    (PC is not in the critical path)
    Therefore, the min clock cycle is 4.43(ns)
    The max operating frequency is 225.7(MHz)

====================================================================================

Floorplan details:

1. Core size: 441.98um * 549.8um (242901.64um^2)
   Chip size (with IO pads): 1264um * 1170um (1478880um^2)
   Core density: 64%
2. Power: We use a vertical power stripe in the middle of the design, and block power rings for IMEM and DMEM.
3. Clock distribution: we route the clock signals in the consideration of performance, so we use positive clock skew in our design.
   For clk signal, we route through PC first and then route through the controller.
   For clk_b signal, we route through IMEM first and then route through DMEM.
