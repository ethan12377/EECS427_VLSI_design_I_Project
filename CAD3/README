Layout Area:
Master bit: 4.8um * 6um
Slave bit: 4.8um * 6.4um

RF bit: 4.8um * (6um+(6.4um*16)+2.8um) = 4.8um * 111.2um
For RF bit, we need sixteen slave bits and one master bit. Then the addtional 2.8um(in height) represents the output inverter for QA and QB.

RF: (4.8um * 16 + 2um) * 111.2um = 78.8um * 111.2um = 8762.56um^2
For RF, we need sixteen RF bits and the control driver(2um in width).

We first implement the layout for the master bit and slave bit. Since these bits will be copied several times in this layout, the sizes are very important. We made it twp layers so that the height and width are close. For subsequent layout, we make READ_A, READ_B, WE_MASTER, WE_clk horizontal through, as well as RSTn, D, QA_bar and QB_bar vertical through. 
With the design of master and slave bit finished, we worked on the layout of the control driver part and output buffer part. During this process, we need to make sure that both the length/width and the connection match the layout of master/slave bit. 
After that, we can compose 16 slave bits, a master bit and a output buffer into a rf bit. Then compose 16 rf bits, master and slave control driver into a whole rf. 
The weigth and height of our final rf design are 78.8um and 111.2um. And the total area is around 8762um^2.
