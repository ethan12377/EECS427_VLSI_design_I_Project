Maximum Rise Delay: 0.258357ns
Between nodes: SEL & OUT

    The IN0 signal go through two NAND gates to the output.
    The IN1 signal go through two NAND gates to the output.
    The SEL signal go through one inverter and two NAND gates to the output.
    Therefore, the critical path is between SEL & OUT.
    
Maximum Fall Delay: 0.199966ns
Between nodes: SEL & OUT

    The IN0 signal go through two NAND gates to the output.
    The IN1 signal go through two NAND gates to the output.
    The SEL signal go through one inverter and two NAND gates to the output.
    Therefore, the critical path is between SEL & OUT.

Inputs for NC verilog simulation:
(All possible input combinations are covered)

INV: IN=0 => IN=1 => IN=0

NAND2: IN0=0, IN1=0 => IN0=0, IN1=1 => IN0=1, IN1=0 => IN0=1, IN1=1

MUX21: IN0=0, IN1=0, SEL=0 => IN0=0, IN1=0, SEL=1 => IN0=0, IN1=1, SEL=0 => IN0=0, IN1=1, SEL=1
    => IN0=1, IN1=0, SEL=0 => IN0=1, IN1=0, SEL=1 => IN0=1, IN1=1, SEL=0 => IN0=1, IN1=1, SEL=1

Layout Area:

INV: 2.8um x 1.2um = 3.36 um^2

NAND2: 2.8um x 2.0um = 5.6 um^2

MUX21: 2.8um x 7.2um = 20.16 um^2

I place the 4 cells in a line, and the order is (NAND2-INV-NAND2-NAND2).
With the configuration, I can minimize the higher level metal usage. (only one line of metal 3)
I mirror the leftmost NAND2 and the inverter to make the connected pins closer to each other,
so that I can minimize the interconnect length.
I also reduce the need for routing using pitch matching (aligning power lines of different cells).
