shifter's design explanation:

For MUXes:
We use one MUX21 to select A and two MUX21es to select the shifter bits.
For shifter:
we first implement a 1 bit left shifter with two pass gate and a keeper in every shift stage. The keeper aims to increase the noise tolerance.
THen we use the RC delay formula to size the inverter in the keeper to minimize the calculated delay. 
Assume that the output capacitor is 25fF and we can find the optimum delay for the critical path.
Then we perform some modification and size the inverter to be 280/560nm, 560/1120nm, 840/1680nm and 1120/2240nm for different levels.
Under this circumstance, total dealy is 0.15ns and is just a little bit higher than the optimum delay.

====================================================================================
Worst case delay:

critical path: A_in*<0> to out<15>
In the logarithmic shifter, any input A to output B includes four levels of shifter. However, A<0> to B<15> has the longest wire, which will result additional delay.

Pre-layout Delay Estimation: 0.15ns


Estimated input pin capacitance
(Estimating the attached transistor load)

A_in*<0:15>:    (0.28+0.56)(um)*1.3(fF/um)		   	        = 1.092(fF)
sh_in*<0:3>:    (0.28+0.56)(um)*1.3(fF/um)			        = 1.092(fF)
A_sel:          (0.28+0.56+0.28+0.56)(um)*1.3(fF/um)		= 2.194(fF)
sh_sel<0:3>:    (0.28+0.56+0.28+0.56)(um)*1.3(fF/um)		= 2.194(fF)

After PEX

A_in*:          8.90601E-15(F)
sh_in*:         1.16641E-15(F)
A_sel:          2.70542E-14(F)
sh_sel:         9.75042E-15(F)

The real capacitances are larger than the esimated ones, which might be due to the neglected wire load during estimation.

Simulation delay time:

Rise delay:     1.193863(ns)
Fall delay:     1.128643(ns)

Inputs for NC verilog simulation:

Layout Area for different hierarchy:

MUX21:			4.8um * 6.8um = 32.64um^2 
shift_280560:		4.8um * 4.4um = 21.12um^2
shift_5601120: 		4.8um * 4.4um = 21.12um^2
shift_8401680:  	4.8um * 4.4um = 21.12um^2
shift_5601120: 		4.8um * 4.4um = 21.12um^2
shifter:		(4.8um*16+2um)*47.2= 3719.36um^2

We frist layout MUX21, inverter, shift_280560, shift_5601120, shift_8401680 and shift_11202240 individually. Then, we combine them together in the shifter cell with hierarchy design. We put different stages shift bit from the bottom to the top. A<0> to A<15> is from left to right. We add mux at the bottom of the layour and inverter on the left hand side of the layout.
To make the Shifter to match the width of ALU and RF, we use bit width = 4.8um and overall Shifter width = 78.8um. The height is 47.2 um. So the total layout area is 78.8um*47.2um=3719.36um^2
